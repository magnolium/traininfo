To get started you need to enable the skill on your Alexa
using the mobile app then enable it on the device with (and I'm guessing here)
"Alexa. Enable Skill Darwin".

Then you have to setup your base station using the CRS (3-char) code.
e.g Worthing is "WRH" Brighton "BTN"

"Alexa. Ask DARWIN <to set code to B M H" 
for Bournemouth.

All calls to DARWIN will then use Bournemouth station as your depature station.

"Alexa. Ask DARWIN <what is the next train to {STATION}>
"Alexa. Ask DARWIN <when is the next train to {STATION}>
"Alexa. Ask DARWIN <when is the next train to {STATION}>

"Alexa. Ask DARWIN <about DEPARTURES>"
"Alexa. Ask DARWIN <about ARRIVALS>"

"Alexa. Ask DARWIN <for info on DEPARTURES>"
"Alexa. Ask DARWIN <for info on ARRIVALS>"

"Alexa. Ask DARWIN <for train DEPARTURES>"
"Alexa. Ask DARWIN <for train ARRIVALS>"

"Alexa. Ask DARWIN <for status on DEPARTURES>"
"Alexa. Ask DARWIN <for status on ARRIVALS>"
